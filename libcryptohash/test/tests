# [B|F] testname [E|P] result
#    [B|F]: Compiler outcome.
#	B: Expect that this test will build.
#	F: Expect that this test will not build.
#    testname: Test case
#	The test that will run. We will try to

#    [E|P|C]: Result type
#	E tells us that the result is an exit status
#	P tells us that the result is on stdout,

#	C tells us that the result is on stdout,
#         and should be compared to the contents of
#         the file passed on the line.
#    result: Result value
#	What we compare with. This should be self-
